# Update and Delete with Flask-RESTful

## Learning Goals

- Build RESTful APIs that are easy to navigate and use in applications.

***

## Key Vocab

- **Representational State Transfer (REST)**: a convention for developing
  applications that use HTTP in a consistent, human-readable, machine-readable
  way.
- **Application Programming Interface (API)**: a software application that
  allows two or more software applications to communicate with one another.
  Can be standalone or incorporated into a larger product.
- **HTTP Request Method**: assets of HTTP requests that tell the server which
  actions the client is attempting to perform on the located resource.
- **`GET`**: the most common HTTP request method. Signifies that the client is
  attempting to view the located resource.
- **`POST`**: the second most common HTTP request method. Signifies that the
  client is attempting to submit a form to create a new resource.
- **`PATCH`**: an HTTP request method that signifies that the client is attempting
  to update a resource with new information.
- **`PUT`**: an HTTP request method that signifies that the client is attempting
  to update a resource with new information contained in a complete record.
- **`DELETE`**: an HTTP request method that signifies that the client is
  attempting to delete a resource.

## Introduction

Now that we've explored how to create and retrieve records with `POST` and
`GET`, let's look into updating records individually and in batches with
`PATCH`.

Run `pipenv install && pipenv shell` to enter your virtual environment. Run
`flask db upgrade` from the `newsletters/` directory to create your database
and `python seed.py` to populate it with seed data.

## Adding a `PATCH` Route

We're just about pros with Flask-RESTful now: if you're feeling confident,
go ahead and try adding a `patch()` method to `NewsletterByID`.

> **TIP: Remember to use `setattr()` to cut down the number of lines of code!

Solution below...

Just as with the `get()` route in this resource, we're going to pass in the `id`
from the URL and use it to retrieve the record we're updating. Unlike the
`get()` route, we want to leave it as a `Newsletter` object instead of
converting it to a dictionary, since we want to change the attributes on the
record.

```py
# newsletters/app.py

class NewsletterByID(Resource):

    # get()

    def patch(self, id):

        record = Newsletter.query.filter_by(id=id).first()
        for attr in request.form:
            setattr(record, attr, request.form[attr])

        db.session.add(record)
        db.session.commit()

        response_dict = record.to_dict()

        response = make_response(
            jsonify(response_dict),
            200
        )

        return response
```

Looping through the form data gives us its keys, the attribute names to be
changed. From there, we can set each attribute on the `Newsletter` object to
its new value with `setattr()`. From here, we update the database with the new
record, create a response with the record, and send it back to the client.

Try it out for yourself: open Postman and navigate to
[http://127.0.0.1:5000/newsletters/20](http://127.0.0.1:5000/newsletters/20).
Change the request method to `PATCH`, edit the `Body > form-data` with a new
body, then hit submit. You should see a response similar to the following:

```json
{
    "body": "blah blah blah blah blah blah blah",
    "edited_at": "2022-09-22 16:50:06",
    "id": 20,
    "published_at": "2022-09-22 16:48:12",
    "title": "Mr. Title"
}
```

Looks like someone didn't enjoy the newsletter from September 22!

***

## Adding a `DELETE` Route

Now that we've identified an unpopular newsletter, it might be a good idea to
head into the API and delete it. To accomplish that, we'll have to add a
`delete()` route to `NewsletterByID`:

```py
# newsletters/app.py

class NewsletterByID(Resource):

    # get(), patch()

    def delete(self, id):

        record = Newsletter.query.filter_by(id=id).first()
        
        db.session.delete(record)
        db.session.commit()

        response_dict = {"message": "record successfully deleted"}

        response = make_response(
            jsonify(response_dict),
            200
        )

        return response
```

Here, we retrieve the record using the `id` passed to the route through the URL,
delete it, and return a message that the record has been successfully deleted:

```json
{
    "message": "record successfully deleted"
}
```

***

## Conclusion

While there are a few nuances that separate Flask-RESTful from vanilla Flask in
building APIs, we can see that they exist to simplify the process of making a
RESTful API: rather than specifying the accepted HTTP request methods and
handling them with `if/elif/else` blocks, methods are used to neatly organize
the routes for `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, and more at each URL.

## Solution Code

```py
# newsletters/app.py

#!/usr/bin/env python3

from flask import Flask, jsonify, request, make_response

app.config['SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS'] = False
app.config['JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR'] = True

migrate = Migrate(app, db)
db.init_app(app)

api = Api(app)

class Index(Resource):

    def get(self):
        
        response_dict = {
            "index": "Welcome to the Newsletter RESTful API",
        }
        
        response = make_response(
            jsonify(response_dict),
            200,
        )

        return response

api.add_resource(Index, '/')

class Newsletters(Resource):

    def get(self):
        
        response_dict_list = [n.to_dict() for n in Newsletter.query.all()]

        response = make_response(
            jsonify(response_dict_list),
            200,
        )

        return response

    def post(self):
        
        new_record = Newsletter(
            title=request.form['title'],
            body=request.form['body'],
        )

        db.session.add(new_record)
        db.session.commit()

        response_dict = new_record.to_dict()

        response = make_response(
            jsonify(response_dict),
            201,
        )

        return response

api.add_resource(Newsletters, '/newsletters')

class NewsletterByID(Resource):

    def get(self, id):

        response_dict = Newsletter.query.filter_by(id=id).first().to_dict()

        response = make_response(
            jsonify(response_dict),
            200,
        )

        return response

    def patch(self, id):

        record = Newsletter.query.filter_by(id=id).first()
        for attr in request.form:
            setattr(record, attr, request.form[attr])

        db.session.add(record)
        db.session.commit()

        response_dict = record.to_dict()

        response = make_response(
            jsonify(response_dict),
            200
        )

        return response

    def delete(self, id):

        record = Newsletter.query.filter_by(id=id).first()
        
        db.session.delete(record)
        db.session.commit()

        response_dict = {"message": "record successfully deleted"}

        response = make_response(
            jsonify(response_dict),
            200
        )

        return response

api.add_resource(NewsletterByID, '/newsletters/<int:id>')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
